### Hey, I'm Sai! ðŸ‘‹

I am an experienced software developer with over three years of expertise in full-stack development, specializing in technologies such as Java, React.js, AWS, SQL, Kafka, and Kubernetes. My proficiency lies in implementing scalable solutions through Kubernetes and microservices, and I have a knack for optimizing performance through caching, which has led to achieving sub-100ms response times for critical REST APIs.
